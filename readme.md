# Mocap

## Development

### Requirements

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Regolith](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/guide/installing)

### Steps

1. This will only ever need to be ran once just to install necessary dependencies: `regolith install-all`
2. This also only ever needs to be ran once: `npm i`
3. Use either `regolith run preview` or `regolith watch preview`. The former will copy the files to your preview pack folders, while the latter will do it everytime you save changes in the packs.
